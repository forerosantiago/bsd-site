    <h1>Home</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome, this is my OpenBSD server, the server uses the operating system of champions, this is my learning environment provided by <a href="https://ircnow.org/">IrcNow</a>.</p>

    <h2>My thoughts on OpenBSD</h2>
    <p>In my opinion, BSD is harder to use than Linux-based distributions, mainly because there is less content about it online and it is less user-friendly than other operating systems. However, I have to admit it is a little bit faster than Linux.</p>
    
    <h2>My process</h2>
    <p>I started playing around with OpenBSD on 24/01/22 - So far I love it! I've run into a few problems but they were easy and quick to solve.</p>

    <h2>To-do list</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Set up an OpenHTTP server with SSL support (done)</li>
        <li>Set up a Ngircd IRC server and make a network (partially done)</li>
        <li>Set up a personal mail server</li>
    </ul>
